# R820T2-and-STM32F407-SDR-receiver
It's experimental SDR (Software Defined Radio) receiver based on the STM32F407 and R820T2 (actually R820T). The repository contains source code for STM32F407 (complete project from STM32IDE) and hardware schematics. Frankly it's more fun and educational project rather than reliable SDR receiver. The motivation for this project was built SDR based on STM32F4DISCOVERY (it has CS43L22 audio DAC) board and R820T module that comes from obsolete DVB-T set-top-box.

R820T2 code is based on Eric's Brombaugh's code: https://github.com/emeb/r820t2/tree/master

Porting, modification, improvements and SDR code was done by @mcy7880 Maciej Fajfer.
